## Introduction

This club was born out a desire of learning and teaching "street" skills;
Skills that are not taught in a conventional classroom setting
and yet are important for professionals in both academic and non-academic fields.

## Long-term vision

Form a community who endorse and practice open and reproducible science.

## Short-term plan

Publish blog posts on this website documenting our first-hand experience with reproducible science.
Organize peer-to-peer learning workshops on R and reproducible science.
