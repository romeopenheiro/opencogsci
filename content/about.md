Currently, there are only two official and one honorary members in this club.

### Romeo Penheiro

I am a graduate student at the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://carleton.ca/cognitivescience/) at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca). More precisely, I work under the supervision of [Dr. Georg Northoff](http://www.georgnorthoff.com). I have a very keen interest in statistical machine learning, computational neuroscience, and data reproducibility. You can learn more about my work in [my personal website](https://romeopenheiro.netlify.app).

### Tristan Shaeen

I am a Masters student in the Cognitive Science department at Carleton University,
studying the way in which artificial intelligence can help us understand natural cognitive processes.
In the Cognitive Modeling Lab,
we compare computational models of cognitive processes to human behaviour 
in order to glean “under-the-hood” insights into the human mind.
My particular research focuses on extending cognitive modelling 
into the area of argument building and argument complexity,
such that we can come to understand the way our own belief structures 
interact in complex social environments.
With separate prior degrees in both philosophy and psychology,
I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand human nature
through both qualitative and quantitative lenses.
Having spent a considerable amount of my life working in the Legal, IT,
and Service industries,
my research tends to be guided by pragmatic social benefit considerations.
I teach a tutorial in the scientific method preparing honours students for their theses,
and tutor statistics in my spare time.
My major loves in life are traveling, conversation, late dinners, and music.


### Chunyun Ma

I wear several hats. I am a research psychologist, a statistics consultant,
an educator, and above all, a geek.
Apart from contributing to content on this website,
I also write on my personal [website](https://chunyunma.me).
